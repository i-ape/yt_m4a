# yt_m4a

cli rust tool with yt-dlp
can get playlists and single files
when playlist it numbers tracks
asks for folder name 
gives 1-10 quality options

# known issues

when down loading a playlist, the files are not moved to a folder that is  not the name intended
when 2nd playlist is downloaded, the files are not moved to a folder that is  not the name in


this file does most of what i want but has a load of flaws

next create rust ffmpeg that if playlist downloaded it puts them in a folder
